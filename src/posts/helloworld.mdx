### backstory
About a week ago, I was digging through some of my old projects, when this little contraption caught my eye:  
![a block of aluminum with three COB LEDs glued to the top of it](todo)  
It's a (really shoddy) LED array! The three chips on the top are 100W-rated COB LEDs, and they're mounted to a water-cooling block&mdash;I didn't have a good way to properly attach them, so I just stuck them on with thermal glue.





### installation

These LEDs are&mdash;I'm guessing&mdash;around 20% efficient, meaning that we'll need to figure out how to carry away around 240 watts if we run the array at its rated output. The array's already mounted to a water-cooling block, so all I had to do was put together a rudimentary water-cooling setup with some stuff I had around:

I figured that was good enough to start installing it, so I put the "reservior"/plastic bucket in my cabinet, drilled a few holes, and sat the array on top:

### not blowing up
So, assuming the cooling system doesn't dissipate any heat, how long can I run this at max power before something bad happens?  
My (*very* entry-level) chem knowledge came in handy here. Both the pump and the LEDs are rated to operate up to 100°C, but I'm less sure about the tubing and reservior, so I'll see how long it'll take to get from 20 to 60°C:

$$
10\mathrm{\,L}
\cdot(60\mathrm{°C} - 20\mathrm{°C})
\cdot\frac{4182\space\mathrm{joules}}{\mathrm{L\cdot °C}} 
\cdot\frac{\mathrm{1\space sec}}{\mathrm{300\space joules}}
\cdot\frac{1\space\mathrm{hour}}{3600\space\mathrm{seconds}}
\approx1.6\space\mathrm{hours}
$$

which is *okayish* given that we probably won't be operating at that high of a power level for more than 30 minutes at a time every 24 hours.
