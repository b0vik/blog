## backstory
about a week ago, I was digging through some of my old projects, when this little contraption caught my eye  
![a block of aluminum with three COB LEDs glued to the top of it](todo)  
it's an array of 3 COB LEDs i bought off aliexpress a while back, stuck to a water cooling block with some thermal glue in lieu of a proper way to mount them.

<script>
  import {math, display} from 'mathlifier';
  const x = Math.ceil(Math.random()*100);
  const displayedMath = display(`x^2 = ${x*x}`);
</script>

## not blowing up
{@html displayedMath}
