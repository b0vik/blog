### backstory
About a week ago, I was digging through some of my old projects, when this little contraption caught my eye:  
![a block of aluminum with three COB LEDs glued to the top of it](todo)  
It's a (really shoddy) LED array! The three chips on the top are 100W-rated COB LEDs, and they're mounted to a water-cooling block&mdash;I didn't have a good way to properly attach them, so I just stuck them on with thermal glue.
I could've put it back, but an idea 

### installation

These LEDs are (as a rough guess) around 20% efficient, meaning that we'll need to figure out how to carry away around 240 watts if we run the array at its rated output. The array's already mounted to a water-cooling block, so all I had to do was put together a rudimentary water-cooling setup with some stuff I had around. After a bit of scavenging, I found some old latex tubing, an aquarium pump, a boost converter, and a random plastic bucket, which was just enough for me to feel confident in running this thing at full power:  
<br>
<div class="image-container" style="display: flex; height: 35ch;"> <img src="/helloworld/images/jankatron-watercooling.jpg" alt="todo" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: contain;"> <img src="/helloworld/images/psu-pic.jpg" alt="todo" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: contain;"> </div> 
<p style="text-align: center;">(it's a little under rating since my psu doesn't go up to 32 volts, but it's close enough)</p>

To the horror and disappointment of everyone reading this, I decided this was probably sorta kinda good enough for installation. After moving some stuff around and drilling a couple holes, I managed to shove everything that was just on the floor into a cabinet.

![the top of a cabinet. there's a boost converter wired to an aquarium pump that's sitting in a planter and a couple of giant LEDs mounted to a water cooling block, as well as a benchtop power supply to the far right](/helloworld/images/early-installation-top.jpg)
<p style="text-align: center;">why is the pump just sitting in a planter? your guess is as good as mine</p>

And that was about enough to turn it on! It's not mounted yet&mdash;the array is literally just sitting flat on the top of a cabinet&mdash;but it's so ridiculously bright that you can sort of get global illumination just by pointing it anywhere. (though my walls being painted white definitely helped out a bit)

### controlling the thing
I wanted to be able to dim the array over http, so just having it directly plugged into a power supply wouldn't do. 
I stuck a few (definitely counterfeit) [rfp30n06le](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/308/rfp30n06le-1195941.pdf) mosfets to another watercooling block with some thermal tape. After a dodgy soldering job and some breadboarding...

my Contraption™ was ready to be programmed.  
   
I've been wanting to move away from using the Arduino framework for a while now, and this project seemed like a relatively simple way to get started, so I went ahead and preemptively vendor-locked myself in by making this project in esp-idf, espressif's dedicated development framework for their socs.  
  
Thankfully for this project, esp-idf has a really well-documented http api, so well-documented that there's already [an example project](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/v5.2/examples/protocols/http_server/restful_server) 
that does almost exactly what we want to do. I cloned the project and modified it a bit so that it actually controlled the leds 
(the esp32-c3 and iirc all of espressif's socs also have a hardware pwm controller with a [fairly nice api](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.2/esp32c3/api-reference/peripherals/ledc.html) somewhat tailored to this purpose) 
and made the temperature endpoint actually check the value of a temperature sensor, and soon enough I had a neat little rest api:

`/api/v1/status, GET`
```js
{
    temps: {
        reservoir: 22.375
    }
    brightness: {
        red: 0,
        green: 0,
        blue: 0,
        warmwhite: 0
    }
}
```

`/api/v1/brightness, POST`
```js
{
    red: 0,
    green: 0,
    blue: 0,
    warmwhite: 1023
}
```

I coded together a command-line client in Rust, also partly as a Learning Exercise™. There's not much worth mentioning in this blog &mdash; it lets me increase/decrease brightness and check the temperatures. 

### mounting
Finally, we can get around to actually mounting this thing. I took some measurements of the LED block and designed a 3D-printed holder to keep it upright, then printed it out and mounted it to the top of the cabinet.

### not blowing up
I still wanted to make sure that, should the cooling system fail for one reason or another, the array wouldn't start a fire, so I put a temperature probe on the array and set up an interrupt to watch the temperature and turn it off if it ever exceeded 70°C.  
  
With that out of the way, there's still one major problem: the cooling system doesn't have any mechanism installed to actually dissipate the heat it carries away, so it's essentially just dumping all of it into the reservoir. I could probably just install a fan and radiator, (and I plan on doing that eventually) 
but how long would it take for something bad to happen if I didn't? I worked out a rough, worst-case estimate:

$$
10\mathrm{\,L}
\cdot(60\mathrm{°C} - 20\mathrm{°C})
\cdot\frac{4182\space\mathrm{joules}}{\mathrm{L\cdot °C}} 
\cdot\frac{\mathrm{1\space sec}}{\mathrm{300\space joules}}
\cdot\frac{1\space\mathrm{hour}}{3600\space\mathrm{seconds}}
\approx1.6\space\mathrm{hours}
$$

Not great, but *okayish* given that we probably won't be operating at that high of a power level for more than 30 minutes at a time every 24 hours.
